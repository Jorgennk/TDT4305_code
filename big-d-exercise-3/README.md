# big-d-exercise-3

## About

This is the third project in the assignments/projects in Big Data Architecture. It is made by Joachim Maksim and myself.
It includes using a password leak and creating a bloom fiter to see if it is in there.

It currently has various print functions used mainly for developing, bug fixing and seeing progress in the program.

## How to use

```

cd code
python bloom.py

```
